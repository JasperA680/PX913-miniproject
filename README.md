# PX913-miniproject
PX913 Scientific Software Development Mini-Project

This repository contains the full solution for the PX913 Scientific SoftwareDevelopment mini-project.

The project solves Poisson's equation using Gauss-Seideliteration on a 2D grid, computes the electric field,
simulates a charged particle using velocity Verlet, and writes all data to a NetCDF file.
